## Overview
The **Face Mask Detection System** is a deep learning-based application that detects whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. It utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification and is trained on a dataset of masked and unmasked faces.

## Features
✅ Real-time face mask detection using a webcam or pre-recorded images.
✅ Trained with a deep CNN model for high accuracy.
✅ Utilizes OpenCV for image preprocessing and face detection.
✅ Supports deployment on various platforms, including mobile and web applications.
✅ Interactive visualization of predictions and confidence scores.

## Technologies Used
🧠 **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras  
🐍 **Programming Language**: Python  
📷 **Image Processing**: OpenCV  
📂 **Dataset**: Publicly available face mask datasets  
🏗️ **Model Architecture**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images categorized into two classes:
1. 😷 **With Mask**
2. 😶 **Without Mask**

The images are preprocessed, augmented, and split into training and testing sets for optimal model performance.

## Installation
1️⃣ Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/face-mask-detection.git
   cd face-mask-detection
   ```
2️⃣ Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3️⃣ Download and prepare the dataset.

## Model Training
🚀 To train the model, run:
```sh
python train.py
```
This will train the CNN model using the specified dataset and save the trained model for inference.

## Running the Face Mask Detector
🎥 To detect masks in real-time using a webcam, execute:
```sh
python detect_mask.py
```

## Results
